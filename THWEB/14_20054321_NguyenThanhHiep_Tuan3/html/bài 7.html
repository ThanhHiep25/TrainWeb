    <h1>HO CHI MINH city</h1>
    <div class="newspaper">
        <p>Ho Chi Minh City is a pretty famous spot for tourist when they come to Vietnam, 
        and there are a lot of things that we should not miss when we come here. 
        Firstly, Sai Gon has many iconic places to visit such as Ben Thanh market,
        Nguyen Hue walking street, Grand Theater etc.
        If we do not take pictures in front of one of those places, 
        people will assume that we had not visited Sai Gon. Secondly, 
        the cuisine here is very diverse and attractive. We can find almost all of the featuring dishes from all parts of Vietnam, 
        and the flavors will not disappoint us. 
        The night markets are true heaven for us to discover and try those foods, 
        and we better prepare our wallet to eat as much as we can. 
        Thirdly, the landscapes outside of the busy center are also very beautiful. 
        We can find large grassfields and clean rivers on the suburb, 
        and many people like to go there for a picnic to enjoy fresh air. 
        Sai Gon can have almost all of the things that we want, 
        and it is a really worthy place to live.</p>
